# Project based on the KDD Cup 2014 Challenge data

## Description

This project uses data from the 'KDD Cup 2014 Challenge' Kaggle Competition and attempts to predict "exciting" DonorsChoose.org projects and correlate them to school poverty levels in different US States. It identifies the top-5 projects per state that would benefit poorer schools. The project also attempts to compute a score indicating how exciting a project is relative to the poverty level of a school.
